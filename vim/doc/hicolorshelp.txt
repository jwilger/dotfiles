2. Usage				*hicolors-usage* *hicolors-use*

	When in vim, type >

   		:help hicolors
<	
	You may use either the mouse if your vim supports it:
	(see |mouse| |win32-mouse| |gui-mouse|) >
		set mouse=a or set mouse=n
		and if your terminal is xterm, msdos, or win32
<
	
	COLORNAME HELP

	A listing of all the colornames will be given in their own
	colors as assigned by your current |colorscheme|. >

		A leftmouse click on the colorname -or-
		moving the cursor atop the colorname and pressing ?
<
	will look up any available help for that particular color.
	Use the ctrl-o key to return to the hicolors listing.
	
	COLORSCHEME EDITING

	Using >

		a rightmouse click  -or-
		pressing the <return> key while atop a colorname
<
	will select the color for editing.  As an example, consider changing
	DiffText: Using console vim, >

		DiffText
		                              -Bold
		  Foregnd[===============: ]  -Italic
		  Backgnd[=========:       ]  -Reverse
		                              -Underline
		
		         WriteColorscheme  Cancel  Done
<
	The colorname (DiffText) will show your current selection of
	colorization.

	You may change the foreground or background colors (click and drag
	with the left mouse button or place the cursor on the Foregnd/Backgnd
	line and press + or - .  

	One may toggle beween -Bold and +Bold, -Italic and +Italic, etc,
	by either left-mouse clicks on the associated word or by placing
	the cursor on the word and hitting the <return> key.

	Using gvim, one gets a slightly different display: >

		DiffText
		         Foreground          Background          -Bold
		    Red  [===============:]  [===============:]  -Italic
		  Green  [===============:]  [:               ]  -Reverse
		   Blue  [===============:]  [:               ]  -Underline
		
		         WriteColorscheme  Cancel  Done
<
	Again, the colorname (DiffText) shows your current colorization
	selection.

	You may change the red, green, and blue contents of the foreground
	by either using a left mouse button click and drag or by hitting
	the + or - keys (with the cursor on the red, green, blue line).

	You may change the red, green, and blue contents of the background
	by either using a left mouse button click and drag or by hitting
	the > or < keys (with the cursor on the red, green, blue line).

	You may make several modifications (use the "Done" label by pressing
	either the left mouse button or pressing <return> while atop the
	label).  If you wish to write a new colorscheme file, select the
	"WriteColorscheme" label (left mouse click or <return> when atop it).
	You will then be queried for what the new colorscheme's filename
	shall be.

3. History						*hicolors-history*

	v8 May 05, 2006 : * Vim 7.0's new colors all included
	                  * When one changes the colorscheme, all colors that
			    should be "Ignore"d now are so linked; these
			    colors aren't specified by the current colorscheme.
	v7 Mar 01, 2006 : * colorscheme editor now supports editing 256-color
	                    xterms
	v6 Jul 12, 2005 : * + - < > keyboard interface installed
	                    (intended for use when mouse support is lacking)
	                  * this help file, hicolorshelp.txt, included
	v5 Apr 13, 2005 : Bug fix: now handles highlighting groups that are
	                  defined without explicit colorization (ie. something with just
	                  gui=reverse, for example).
	v4 Sep 03, 2004 : included SignColumn
	v3 Sep 03, 2004 : first release
